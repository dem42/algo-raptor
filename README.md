algoviz
=======

The idea of the algoviz project is to create visualizations of famous algorithms in d3.

Stepping through visualizations is an excellent and quick way to learn how an algorithm works and having seen the algorithm in action 
helps in remembering it.


How to start
============
Download vagrant and virtual box and run
    
    vagrant init
    vagrant up
    
This will start the 'node.js' server in a virtual machine.

After running these commands the algoviz website will be accessible on 'http://localhost:8989'
