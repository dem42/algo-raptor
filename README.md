AlgoRaptor
=======

The idea of the AlgoRaptor project is to create visualizations of famous algorithms in `d3`.

Stepping through visualizations is an excellent and quick way to learn how an algorithm works. Furthermore, having seen the algorithm in action helps in remembering it.


How do I use it?
----------------

* To see it in action simply visit http://dem42.github.io/algo-raptor/

* To use the dynamic version with a `node.js` instance running on your machine use `vagrant` and `virutal-box` have a look at the instructions below.


How do I run it locally?
-----------------------
Download `vagrant` and `virtual box` and run
    
    vagrant init
    vagrant up
    
This will start the `node.js` server in a virtual machine.

After running these commands the AlgoRaptor website will be accessible on `http://localhost:8989`
