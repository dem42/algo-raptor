Algoviz
=======

The idea of the algoviz project is to create visualizations of famous algorithms in `d3`.

Stepping through visualizations is an excellent and quick way to learn how an algorithm works. Furthermore, having seen the algorithm in action helps in remembering it.


How do I use it?
----------------

Download vagrant and virtual box and run
    
    vagrant init
    vagrant up
    
This will start the `node.js` server in a virtual machine.

After running these commands the algoviz website will be accessible on `http://localhost:8989`
